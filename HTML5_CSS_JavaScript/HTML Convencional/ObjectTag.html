    <!--The <object> tag The <object> tag embeds an object within an HTML document.
    You can embed multimedia such as audio, video, Java applets, ActiveX, PDF, and Flash in your webpages.
    The <object> tag contains the following attributes.
    ■■ data Supplies the URL of the resource to be used by the object
    ■■ form Indicates one or more form ids to which the object belongs
    ■■ height Specifies the height in pixels of the object
    ■■ name Defines the name of the object
    ■■ type Defines the MIME type of data specified in the data attribute
    ■■ usemap Indicates the name of a client-side image map to be used with the object
    ■■ width Specifies the width in pixels of the object-->
    <!--You can also use the <object>
    tag to embed another webpage in your HTML document. The following is an example of using the <object>
    element to embed a webpage in your HTML document.-->

    <object id="headerContent" standby="loading header..." title="loading header..." width="100%" height="15%" type="text/html" data="Email.html"></object>

    <!--As a rule, consider using the <iframe> tag when embedding a webpage from another domain into
    your HTML document by using sandboxing. It’s made for that purpose, whereas the <object> tag is
    a more general-purpose tag. The <object> tag behaves differently with different browsers, and you
    might find that features such as tooltips work only with the <iframe> tag and not with the
    <object> tag.-->
    <!--It is possible to embed images and image maps in your HTML document by using the
    <object> tag, but you should avoid doing so. It’s best to use the <img> tag to embed images.-->
   
    <!--Passing parameters to an object Because the <object> tag can represent any object, the <param>
    tag enables you to pass data to the object. You can use one or more <param>
    tags to pass parameters to plug-ins that have been embedded with the <object> tag. The
    <param> tags must be before any alternate text that is within the <object> element.-->
    
    <!--The <param> tag has a name and a value attribute, and both are required for each <param> tag. The following 
    is an example of using a <param> tag with an audio file to keep the audio file from automatically playing when 
    the page is loaded.-->
        
    <object data="tada.wav"> 
        <param name="autoplay" value="true" /> 
    </object>
