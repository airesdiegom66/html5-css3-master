    <!--- IFRAME: The sandbox attribute places a set of extra restrictions on any content hosted by the iframe. When the sandbox attribute is set, the content is treated as being from a unique and potentially dangerous origin. Forms and scripts are disabled, and links are prevented from targeting other browsing contexts. Consider the following example.
        <iframe sandbox src="http://someOtherDomain.net/content"> </iframe>
    In the example, the source is referencing potentially hostile content in a different domain. This content will be affected by all the normal cross-site restrictions. In addition, the content will have scripting, plug-ins, and forms disabled. The content cannot navigate any frames or windows other than itself.

    The restrictions can be overridden by space-separating any of the following. 
    ■■ allow-forms Enables forms 
    ■■ allow-same-origin Allows the content to be treated as being from the same origin instead of forcing it into a unique origin 
    ■■ allow-scripts Enables scripts except pop-ups 
    ■■ allow-top-navigation Allows the content to navigate its top-level browsing context-->
