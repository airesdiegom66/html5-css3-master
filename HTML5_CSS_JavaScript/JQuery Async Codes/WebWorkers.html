        It’s common to start a web worker, which creates its own event loop and waits for further input. This is similar to a service, which starts and waits for input and doesn’t
        terminate after processing input. Consider the following HTML page that accepts input and has a button that sends the input to a web worker.
        The web worker responds once for each character in the message sent, returning the uppercase of the letter.

    <input type="text" id="message" value="Enter message here" /><br />     
    <button id="btnSend" type="button">Send Message</button><br />     
    <div id="result"></div>
