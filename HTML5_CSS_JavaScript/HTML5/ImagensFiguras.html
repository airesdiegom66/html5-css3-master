    <!--When using the 'figure'
    element, remember that the figure is related to the main content of the page, and the figure’s location is not important. This is different from the 'aside'
    element, which is more related to the site than to the page’s document. If placement is important, don’t use the 'figure'
    element; use the 'div' element. The following example shows the use of the 'figure' and 'figcaption'
    elements (bolded) to display an image that is referred to in the main document of the webpage.-->
