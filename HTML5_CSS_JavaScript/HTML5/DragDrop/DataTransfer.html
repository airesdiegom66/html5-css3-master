    <!--Using the DataTransfer object 
    
    The previous example demonstrates a complete drag and drop operation, 
    but you can also use the DataTransfer object to pass data from the dragstart event to the drop event. 
    By using the DataTransfer object, you don’t need to create a global variable to reference the item being dragged. 
    Using the DataTransfer object also empowers you to pass any data to the drop event as long as it can be represented as a string or URL. 
    The DragStart object is referenced as a dataTransfer property on the dragstart event.-->
