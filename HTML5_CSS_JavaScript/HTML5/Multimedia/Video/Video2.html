        You should also include more than one 'source' element to provide many sources so the browser can choose the most appropriate video codec. <br />
        In the following example, the same movie has been rendered for each of the three most popular formats.
    </p>
    <p>
        The position of the 'source' elements is important because a browser starts looking at the top and stops when it finds a file that it can display.<br />
        The recommended order is to start with the .webm file because it’s royalty free and open source, and it’s becoming more popular.<br />
        Next, use the .ogv file because it is also royalty free, but the quality is not as good as the .webm file.<br />
        Finally, use the .mp4 format for browsers that don’t support .webm or .ogv files.

        The type attribute includes both the MIME type and the codecs. <br />
        Although the type attribute isn’t usually required, the browser can use it to help choose the proper video file to display.
